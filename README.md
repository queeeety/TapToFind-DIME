# üéµ TapToFind ‚Äì Rethink How You Search, Create & Protect Music

**TapToFind** (MusicTap) is a conceptual startup project built as part of a university innovation challenge in Spring 2025.
<br>The goal? To make music recognition accessible not only to listeners ‚Äî but also to empower artists through rhythm-based search, AI assistance, and copyright safety.

---

## Project Overview

MusicTap is a **non-functional prototype** and **static informational website** showcasing the vision of an app that allows users to **tap the rhythm of a melody to identify a song** ‚Äî even if no recording is available.

The app idea expands beyond search. It also provides:
- AI suggestions for finishing your own songs
- Plagiarism detection tools
- A licensing model for developers to use the recognition engine via API

---

## Project Outcomes

This was a **startup-oriented group project**. The main objective wasn‚Äôt programming but:
- **Market & competitor research**
-  **Business model development** (freemium, PRO tiers, API licensing)
-  **Financial analysis & pricing**
-  **Pitch deck, value proposition canvas, user personas**
-  **Feature ideation** based on real user problems

The static site was created to communicate our concept, pricing, competitive advantages and growth model.
